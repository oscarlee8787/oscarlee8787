_Junior data scientist with background in business_

Hey there, I'm Oscar. I am kickstarting my new career in the field of data science and artificial intelligence. I have a Master's degree in entrepreneurship and worked in venture capital. I eventually co-founded a company that turns organic waste into high-quality protein using insect farms.

> Looking forward to connecting and working on collaborative projects!
