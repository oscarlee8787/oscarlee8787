_Junior data scientist with background in business_

Hey there, I'm Oscar. I have a Master's degree in entrepreneurship and worked in venture capital. I eventually co-founded a company that turns organic waste into high-quality protein using insect farms. Always striving to cultivate a more data driven mindset, I attended a data science bootcamp to kickstart my new career in the field of machine learning and neural networks.

> Looking forward to connecting and working on collaborative projects!
